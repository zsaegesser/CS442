PART 1:
  ER Diagrams

  Cardinality Constraints
    -4 types:
      -One-to-One (1:1)

  Participation Constraints & Weak Entities

  ISA & Agregation *****WILL BE ON FINAL*****
    -ISA
      -inheritence
      -overlap/covering
    -aggregation

  E/R Relations
    -all cardinalities
    -weak entity sets
    -ISA hierarchies to relations
    -aggregation

PART2:
  Relational Algebra
      -selection
      -projection
      -cross-product
      -set-difference
      -union
    compound operators
      -joins
      -division

  Sequel
    -COUNT(*)
    -COUNT([DISTINCT] A)
    -SUM([DISTINCT] A)

    GROUP BY & HAVING
    -For each keyword


  Schema Refinement
    -functional dependency X->Y

    -3 basic Armstrongs Axioms
    -2 advanced Union & Decomposition

    -Normal Forms
      1st, 2nd, 3rd, BCNF(3.5 NF)
        -always start checking at 2nd, 1st is unnessesary
    -BCNF Decomposition
      -guarentee lossless and
    -3NF Decomposition
      -lossless and dependency preserving
